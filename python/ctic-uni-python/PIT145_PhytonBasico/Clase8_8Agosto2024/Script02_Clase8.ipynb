By default, we identify singular values less\n","        than ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps`` as indicating rank deficiency (with\n","        the symbols defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1].  It also\n","        appears in *Numerical recipes* in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear\n","        least squares [2].\n","        \n","        This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting for\n","        the numerical errors of the SVD computation.  Imagine that there is a column\n","        in `A` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination of other\n","        columns in `A`. Computing the SVD on `A` will not produce a singular value\n","        exactly equal to 0 in general: any difference of the smallest SVD value from\n","        0 will be caused by numerical imprecision in the calculation of the SVD.\n","        Our threshold for small SVD values takes this numerical imprecision into\n","        account, and the default threshold will detect such numerical rank\n","        deficiency.  The threshold may declare a matrix `A` rank deficient even if\n","        the linear combination of some columns of `A` is not exactly equal to\n","        another column of `A` but only numerically very close to another column of\n","        `A`.\n","        \n","        We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use.  Other thresholds\n","        are possible.  For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of *Numerical\n","        recipes* there is an alternative threshold of ``S.max() *\n","        np.finfo(A.dtype).eps / 2. * np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)``. The authors describe\n","        this threshold as being based on \"expected roundoff error\" (p 71).\n","        \n","        The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the\n","        calculation of the SVD.  However, you may have more information about the\n","        sources of error in `A` that would make you consider other tolerance values\n","        to detect *effective* rank deficiency.  The most useful measure of the\n","        tolerance depends on the operations you intend to use on your matrix.  For\n","        example, if your data come from uncertain measurements with uncertainties\n","        greater than floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance near that\n","        uncertainty may be preferable.  The tolerance may be absolute if the\n","        uncertainties are absolute rather than relative.\n","        \n","        References\n","        ----------\n","        ..

analysis is fundamentally a method for expressing a function as a\n","    sum of periodic components, and for recovering the function from those\n","    components.  When both the function and its Fourier transform are\n","    replaced with discretized counterparts, it is called the discrete Fourier\n","    transform (DFT).  The DFT has become a mainstay of numerical computing in\n","    part because of a very fast algorithm for computing it, called the Fast\n","    Fourier Transform (FFT), which was known to Gauss (1805) and was brought\n","    to light in its current form by Cooley and Tukey [CT]_.  Press et al. [NR]_\n","    provide an accessible introduction to Fourier analysis and its\n","    applications.\n","    \n","    Because the discrete Fourier transform separates its input into\n","    components that contribute at discrete frequencies, it has a great number\n","    of applications in digital signal processing, e.g., for filtering, and in\n","    this context the discretized input to the transform is customarily\n","    referred to as a *signal*, which exists in the *time domain*.  The output\n","    is called a *spectrum* or *transform* and exists in the *frequency\n","    domain*.\n","    \n","    Implementation details\n","    ----------------------\n","    \n","    There are many ways to define the DFT, varying in the sign of the\n","    exponent, normalization, etc.  In this implementation, the DFT is defined\n","    as\n","    \n","    .. math::\n","       A_k =  \\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} a_m \\exp\\left\\{-2\\pi i{mk \\over n}\\right\\}\n","       \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,n-1.\n","    \n","    The DFT is in general defined for complex inputs and outputs, and a\n","    single-frequency component at linear frequency :math:`f` is\n","    represented by a complex exponential\n","    :math:`a_m = \\exp\\{2\\pi i\\,f m\\Delta t\\}`, where :math:`\\Delta t`\n","    is the sampling interval.\n","    \n","    The values in the result follow so-called \"standard\" order: If ``A =\n","    fft(a, n)``, then ``A[0]`` contains the zero-frequency term (the sum of\n","    the signal), which is always purely real for real inputs. Then ``A[1:n/2]``\n","    contains the positive-frequency terms, and ``A[n/2+1:]`` contains the\n","    negative-frequency terms, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.\n","    For an even number of input points, ``A[n/2]`` represents both positive and\n","    negative Nyquist frequency, and is also purely real for real input.  For\n","    an odd number of input points, ``A[(n-1)/2]`` contains the largest positive\n","    frequency, while ``A[(n+1)/2]`` contains the largest negative frequency.\n","    The routine ``np.fft.fftfreq(n)`` returns an array giving the frequencies\n","    of corresponding elements in the output.  The routine\n","    ``np.fft.fftshift(A)`` shifts transforms and their frequencies to put the\n","    zero-frequency components in the middle, and ``np.fft.ifftshift(A)`` undoes\n","    that shift.\n","    \n","    When the input `a` is a time-domain signal and ``A = fft(a)``, ``np.abs(A)``\n","    is its amplitude spectrum and ``np.abs(A)**2`` is its power spectrum.\n","    The phase spectrum is obtained by ``np.angle(A)``.\n","    \n","    The inverse DFT is defined as\n","    \n","    .. math::\n","       a_m = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}A_k\\exp\\left\\{2\\pi i{mk\\over n}\\right\\}\n","       \\qquad m = 0,\\ldots,n-1.\n","    \n","    It differs from the forward transform by the sign of the exponential\n","    argument and the default normalization by :math:`1/n`.\n","    \n","    Type Promotion\n","    --------------\n","    \n","    `numpy.fft` promotes ``float32`` and ``complex64`` arrays to ``float64`` and\n","    ``complex128`` arrays respectively. For an FFT implementation that does not\n","    promote input arrays, see `scipy.fftpack`.\n","    \n","    Normalization\n","    -------------\n","    \n","    The argument ``norm`` indicates which direction of the pair of direct/inverse\n","    transforms is scaled and with what normalization factor.\n","    The default normalization (``\"backward\"``) has the direct (forward) transforms\n","    unscaled and the inverse (backward) transforms scaled by :math:`1/n`. It is\n","    possible to obtain unitary transforms by setting the keyword argument ``norm``\n","    to ``\"ortho\"`` so that both direct and inverse transforms are scaled by\n","    :math:`1/\\sqrt{n}`. Finally, setting the keyword argument ``norm`` to\n","    ``\"forward\"`` has the direct transforms scaled by :math:`1/n` and the inverse\n","    transforms unscaled (i.e. exactly opposite to the default ``\"backward\"``).\n","    `None` is an alias of the default option ``\"backward\"`` for backward\n","    compatibility.\n","    \n","    Real and Hermitian transforms\n","    -----------------------------\n","    \n","    When the input is purely real, its transform is Hermitian, i.e., the\n","    component at frequency :math:`f_k` is the complex conjugate of the\n","    component at frequency :math:`-f_k`, which means that for real\n","    inputs there is no information in the negative frequency components that\n","    is not already available from the positive frequency components.\n","    The family of `rfft` functions is\n","    designed to operate on real inputs, and exploits this symmetry by\n","    computing only the positive frequency components, up to and including the\n","    Nyquist frequency.  Thus, ``n`` input points produce ``n/2+1`` complex\n","    output points.  The inverses of this family assumes the same symmetry of\n","    its input, and for an output of ``n`` points uses ``n/2+1`` input points.\n","    \n","    Correspondingly, when the spectrum is purely real, the signal is\n","    Hermitian.  The `hfft` family of functions exploits this symmetry by\n","    using ``n/2+1`` complex points in the input (time) domain for ``n`` real\n","    points in the frequency domain.\n","    \n","    In higher dimensions, FFTs are used, e.g., for image analysis and\n","    filtering.  The computational efficiency of the FFT means that it can\n","    also be a faster way to compute large convolutions, using the property\n","    that a convolution in the time domain is equivalent to a point-by-point\n","    multiplication in the frequency domain.\n","    \n","    Higher dimensions\n","    -----------------\n","    \n","    In two dimensions, the DFT is defined as\n","    \n","    .. math::\n","       A_{kl} =  \\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\n","       a_{mn}\\exp\\left\\{-2\\pi i \\left({mk\\over M}+{nl\\over N}\\right)\\right\\}\n","       \\qquad k = 0, \\ldots, M-1;\\quad l = 0, \\ldots, N-1,\n","    \n","    which extends in the obvious way to higher dimensions, and the inverses\n","    in higher dimensions also extend in the same way.\n","    \n","    References\n","    ----------\n","    \n","    ..
